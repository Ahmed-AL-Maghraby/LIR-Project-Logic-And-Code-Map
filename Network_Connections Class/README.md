## GetNetworkConnections
This function is the entry point of the process and serves as the main method to retrieve and process network connection data.

```c#
public void GetNetworkConnections()
        {
            myform.Networktable.DataSource = LoadCSV();
            foreach(DataGridViewRow row in myform.Networktable.Rows)
            {
                try
                {
                    if (int.Parse(row.Cells[10].Value.ToString()) > 0 || (int.Parse(row.Cells[11].Value.ToString()) > 0))
                    {
                        row.DefaultCellStyle.BackColor = Color.Red;
                        row.DefaultCellStyle.ForeColor = Color.White;
                    }
                }catch(Exception ex) { }
                
            }
            MessageBox.Show("Done");
        }
```
Here's how the function works:
   - It first calls the `LoadCSV()` method to load data from a CSV file into a DataTable, and then sets the DataTable as the data source of the `myform.Networktable` DataGridView control on the main form.
   - Next, it iterates through each row of the DataGridView.
   - For each row, it attempts to parse the values in columns 10 and 11 to integers using `int.Parse()`.
   - If the parsing is successful, it checks if either column 10 or column 11 has a value greater than zero, which indicates an active network connection.
   - If a row has an active network connection, it changes the background color to red and the foreground (text) color to white to visually highlight the connection.
   - Any exceptions that occur during parsing are caught and ignored using a try-catch block.
   - After processing all rows, it displays a message box showing "Done" to indicate the completion of the operation.

<br/>

## netstatcommand
This function runs the `netstat` command in the Windows command prompt (`cmd.exe`) and redirects the output to a file named "netstat_output.txt".
```c#
```
Here's how the function works:
   - It creates a new `Process` object and sets its `FileName` property to "cmd.exe" and its `Arguments` property to "/C netstat -no > netstat_output.txt".
   - The `/C` parameter tells `cmd.exe` to run the specified command and then terminate.
   - The `process.Start()` method is called to start the process, and `process.WaitForExit()` is called to wait for the command to finish before continuing execution.

<br/>

## netstat_output
This function processes the "netstat_output.txt" file generated by the `netstatcommand()` method.
```c#
```
 Here's how the function works:
   - It reads the entire contents of the file into a string variable `fileContents`.
   - Several string replacement operations are performed to clean up the content and format it correctly:
     - Replacing spaces with commas.
     - Replacing multiple consecutive commas with a single comma.
     - Removing the header line "Active,Connections".
     - Replacing colons with commas.
     - Removing the line with the column headers "Proto,Local,Address,Foreign,Address,State,PID".
   - The processed output is then written back to a new file named "netstat_output.csv".

<br/>

## GetColumnAsArry
This function reads a specific column from the "netstat_output.csv" CSV file and returns its values as an array of strings.
```c#
```
Here's how the function works:
   - It initializes a List of strings named `ColumnArray` to store the values.
   - It uses a `TextFieldParser` to read the CSV file and set the delimiters to commas.
   - While reading the CSV file, it extracts the values from the specified column (based on the `columnIndex` parameter) and adds them to the `ColumnArray`.
   - After processing all rows, it converts the List to an array and returns it.

<br/>

## WriteColumnToCSV
This function writes a string array into a specific column of the "netstat_output.csv" CSV file.
```c#
```
Here's how the function works:
   - It reads all the lines from the CSV file into a string array named `lines`.
   - It then iterates through each line in the array.
   - For each line, it appends the value from the corresponding position in the `column` array (based on the index) and separated by a comma.
   - The modified lines are then written back to the "netstat_output.csv" file, effectively updating the specified column.

<br/>

## GetprocessName
This function retrieves the process names associated with the Process IDs (PIDs) present in the CSV file.
```c#
```
Here's how the function works:
   - It first retrieves the Process IDs from the CSV file using `GetColumnAsArry(6)`.
   - For each Process ID, it tries to get the corresponding `Process` object using `Process.GetProcessById()`.
   - If successful, it retrieves the process name and stores it in a string array named `names`.
   - If an exception occurs (e.g., the process does not exist), it stores "error" in the `names` array.
   - Finally, it calls `WriteColumnToCSV(names)` to update the "Process Name" column in the CSV file with the process names.

<br/>

## GetHostName
This function retrieves hostnames associated with the IP addresses present in the CSV file.
```c#
```
Here's how the function works:
   - It first retrieves the IP addresses from the CSV file using `GetColumnAsArry(3)`.
   - For each IP address, it tries to get the corresponding `IPHostEntry` object using `Dns.GetHostEntry()`.
   - If successful, it retrieves the hostname and stores it in a string array named `hostname`.
   - If an exception occurs (e.g., DNS resolution fails), it stores an empty string in the `hostname` array.
   - Finally, it calls `WriteColumnToCSV(hostname)` to update the "Host Name" column in the CSV file with the hostnames.

<br/>

## AbuseIPDBScanAndCountry
 This function performs an API call to the AbuseIPDB service to obtain abuse confidence scores and country codes for the IP addresses present in the CSV file.
```c#
```
Here's how the function works:
   - It first retrieves the IP addresses from the CSV file using `GetColumnAsArry(3)`.
   - For each IP address, it constructs the API URL and sends an HTTP request using `HttpClient`.
   - It sets the necessary headers, including an API key for authentication.
   - It handles the API response and extracts the abuse confidence score and country code from the JSON data.
   - If the abuse confidence score is greater than zero, it stores the score and country code in respective arrays (`Score` and `countrys`).
   - If the API call fails or an error occurs, it stores error messages in the arrays.
   - Finally, it calls `WriteColumnToCSV(countrys)` and `WriteColumnToCSV(Score)` to update the "IP Country" and "AbuseIPDB Score" columns in the CSV file.

<br/>

## VirusTotalIpScanner()`:
This function performs an API call to the VirusTotal service to obtain scan results for the IP addresses present in the CSV file.
```c#
```
Here's how the function works:
   - It first retrieves the IP addresses from the CSV file using `GetColumnAsArry(3)`.
   - For each IP address, it calls an external `VirustotalScaner.GetIpScanResult()` method (not shown here) to obtain the scan result for that IP.
   - The scan results are stored in a string array named `result`.
   - Finally, it calls `WriteColumnToCSV(result)` to update the "VirusTotal" column in the CSV file with the scan results.

<br/>

## LoadCSV
This function orchestrates the entire data processing workflow.
```c#
```
Here's how the function works:
    - It calls `netstat_output()`, `GetprocessName()`, `GetHostName()`, `AbuseIPDBScanAndCountry()`, and `VirusTotalIpScanner()` methods to process the data and
